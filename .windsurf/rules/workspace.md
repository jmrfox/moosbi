This is a repository for a Python package I am developing for use in scientific modeling.
I want to develop the package in the directory `moosbi`. 
Jupyter notebooks go in `notebooks`. 
Python scripts go in `scripts`.
I use the `uv` package manager. We need to run scripts using `uv run`, and run tests using `uv run pytest`.
Project configuration is in `pyproject.toml`.
